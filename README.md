# Zhanfu Yang
Hello, 

My name is Zhanfu Yang and I am a Second year Ph.D. in Computer Engineering. 

I am taking this class because I want to be proficient in Java and learn some distributed computing language like Hadoop. 

My goal for taking this class are to fluently understanding the Java language.
